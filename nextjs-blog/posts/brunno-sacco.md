Bruno Sacco (12 November 1933 – 19 September 2024) was an Italian automobile designer and chief engineer, who served as the head of styling at the Daimler-Benz AG, the German manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz automobiles and trucks, from 1975 to 1999. Since Bruno Sacco was hired as a Mercedes-Benz stylist in 1958, his career and contributions to their vehicles' industrial design spanned more than four decades.

Sacco rose through the corporate ranks at Daimler-Benz over the next fifteen years, becoming chief engineer in 1974, before taking over from Friedrich Geiger as head of the Daimler-Benz styling center at Sindelfingen in 1975.[1][4] For the next quarter century, until he retired in 1999, he was responsible for the design of every Mercedes road car, bus, and truck.[5] Among his numerous works are the C111 concept car, three successive generations of the S‑Class luxury saloons, (the W126, W140, and W220), the R129 SL convertible, the C-Class W202 compact executive car, the W124 and W210 versions of the E-Class sedan, the CLK and SLK sports cars, the M-Class luxury sport utility vehicle, and second generation C‑Class W203.[1] Sacco made significant contributions to the design of the Mercedes W123, the best selling Mercedes-Benz ever,[6] as well as his very last design, the R230 SL convertible (in 1997). Sacco's favourite design, because of its significance to the company's history, is the Mercedes-Benz 190 introduced in 1982. It is also known as the W201.
